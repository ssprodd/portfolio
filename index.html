                <p class="duration">2021 - 2023 (almost 2 years)</p>
                <p>At Freightwalla, I spearheaded initiatives that significantly optimized logistics operations and 
                    drove substantial business growth. I led the development and launch of a new product for 
                    international clients, automating workflows and multi-party billing, which resulted in 
                    acquiring new clients and driving 30% of bookings and 20% of revenue.

                    <p>My passion for building efficient and impactful solutions is evident 
                    in my championing of the tracking product, where I collaborated with vendors 
                    and leveraged API integrations to achieve &gt;90% shipment visibility. This not 
                    only increased customer satisfaction but also generated new revenue streams. 
                    Furthermore, I demonstrated my ability to leverage data and technology to streamline
                    processes and reduce costs by 20% through the development of a data-driven Vendor 
                    Invoice Management System. This system, powered by machine learning and enhanced visibility, 
                    significantly reduced disputes and manual work.</p>

                <p>At DICE, I was instrumental in building their core expense management product and 
                    driving its adoption. I spearheaded the development of a robust policy engine 
                    that automated expense processing, ensuring compliance and reducing manual effort. 
                    This innovative solution became a key differentiator for DICE, attracting new

                <div class="expanded-details">
                    <p>To further accelerate this growth, I led 
                    the go-to-market strategy, which included a targeted lead generation campaign 
                    focused on identifying and qualifying leads based on specific personas. This 
                    involved leveraging no-code automation tools to streamline outreach and

                <p>At SAIL, I honed my product development and technical skills while contributing to critical
